# Corner Grocer â€“ CS210 Portfolio Submission

## ðŸ”¹ What was the project and what problem did it solve?
The Corner Grocer project tracked how often items were purchased in a grocery store. It read item names from a file, counted them using a map, and showed the results in a menu format. It helped store owners understand product popularity and manage inventory.

## ðŸ”¹ What did I do well?
I implemented file input/output and used a C++ map for frequency tracking. The menu system was simple and user-friendly.

## ðŸ”¹ What could be improved?
I could make the code more modular with better error handling and input validation. This would improve security, efficiency, and scalability.

## ðŸ”¹ What was challenging?
Creating the histogram display and working with file streams was tricky. I used the textbook and debugging tools to figure it out.

## ðŸ”¹ Transferable skills:
- C++ file handling and logic
- Menu-based program design
- Debugging and testing
- Writing clean, readable code

## ðŸ”¹ How did I make it maintainable?
Clear function structure, consistent naming, and comments throughout made the code easy to read and update later.
